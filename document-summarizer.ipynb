A procedure is a subroutine or a subprogram in the language of the database. Triggers are used to invoke procedures by using other triggers, such as Java, Python, PHP, etc. The Data Controlling Language (DCL) helps users to retrieve, modify and delete data stored on the server. DCL commands can be used to grant or revoke user permissions and privileges as per the administrator’s needs. The DBA is the focal point for data/user interaction in an organization.
